This directory demonstrates how to use Dev Container locally.

Please install Docker daemon and VS Code first, and ensure "docker" and "code" commands are in your PATH.

You can use `start.sh` or `start-clean.sh` to start VS Code / Dev Container.

If you want to use stack, please refer to https://github.com/LCamel/HaskellSpace#stack .
